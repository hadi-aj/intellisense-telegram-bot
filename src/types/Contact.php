 * This object represents a phone contact.

 * @property String $phone_number Contact's phone number
 * @property String $first_name Contact's first name
 * @property String $last_name Optional. Contact's last name
 * @property Integer $user_id Optional. Contact's user identifier in Telegram. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
 * @property String $vcard Optional. Additional data about the contact in the form of a vCard
